Description: The `sreg' package offers a toolkit for estimating average treatment effects (ATEs) in stratified randomized experiments. 
     The package is designed to accommodate scenarios with multiple treatments and cluster-level treatment assignments, and accomodates 
     optimal linear covariate adjustment based on baseline observable characteristics. The package computes estimators and standard errors 
     based on Bugni, Canay, Shaikh (2018), Bugni, Canay, Shaikh, Tabord-Meehan (2023), and Jiang, Linton, Tang, Zhang (2023).
