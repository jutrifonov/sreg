Title: ATE Estimation under CAR and Cluster-Level Treatment Assignment
Version: 2.2.1

Description: The 'sreg' package offers a robust toolkit for estimating average treatment effects (ATEs) 
  within the context of a stratified block randomization design under the covariate-adaptive randomization (CAR). 
  Designed to accommodate scenarios with multiple treatments and cluster-level treatment assignments, the 'sreg' 
  package not only provides ATE estimators but also includes sophisticated features for calculating adjusted 
  variance estimators developed in papers (Bugni, Canay, Shaikh; 2017),
  (Bugni, Canay, Shaikh, Tabord-Meehan; 2023) and (Jiang, Linton, Tang, Zhang, 2023).
